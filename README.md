New functionality requires the following python3 libraries (which may need to be installed)
* ```requests``` (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
* ```BeautifulSoup4``` (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
* ```datetime```
* ```date``` (from ```datetime```)

New functionality also requires creating a new table ```mediaserver.movieRatings``` and stored function ```mediaserver.addMovieRatings()``` on pgAdmin (see mediaserver_schema.sql)
